# estmeansd-ShinyApp: Shiny App for the estmeansd R package

This Shiny App (launched [here](https://smcgrath.shinyapps.io/estmeansd)) applies the approaches of [McGrath et al. (2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0962280219889080) and [Cai et al. (2021)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09622802211047348) for estimating the sample mean and standard deviation from the sample median and one or both of (i) the minimum and maximum values and (ii) the first and third quartiles. This app also applies the corresponding standard error estimators based on the parametric bootstrap approach of [McGrath et al. (in press)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14386).

The corresponding R package is `estmeansd`, available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=estmeansd) and [GitHub](https://github.com/stmcg/estmeansd).
