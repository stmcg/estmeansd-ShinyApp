# estmeansd-Shiny-App

A Shiny App (launched [here](https://smcgrath.shinyapps.io/estmeansd)) applying the approaches of [McGrath et al. (2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0962280219889080) for estimating the sample mean and standard deviation from the sample median and one or both of (i) the minimum and maximum values and (ii) the first and third quartiles.

The corresponding R package is `estmeansd`, available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=estmeansd) and [GitHub](https://github.com/stmcg/estmeansd).
